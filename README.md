#This library is old

I don't have time to update this library like I wanted to but Ed Wellbrook created a much better version [here](https://github.com/edwellbrook/node-tvdb).

*This library still works, so you can still use it if you like.*

# Thetvdb-api

Node.js library for accessing [TheTVDB Api](http://www.thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php/Programmers_API).

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Api](#api)
* [License](#license)



## Installation

Install with the Node.JS package manager [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

```bash
npm install thetvdb-api
```

or

Install via git clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joaocampinhos/thetvdb-api.git
cd thetvdb-api
npm install
```



## Usage

To start using this library you first need an API key. You can request one [here](http://thetvdb.com/?tab=apiregister).
Then just follow this simple example that fetches all the shows containing "the Simpsons" in the name.

```js
var tvDB    = require("thetvdb-api"),
    key     = "abc123";

tvDB(key).getSeries("the Simpsons", function(err, res) {
  if (!err) console.log(res);
});
```



## API

Since this api is a little bit different that the usual REST api's I tried to change things a bit and simplified some of the names.
Not all API endpoints are available but you can see them all here:
<http://www.thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php/Programmers_API#File_Structure>

Here are the ones provided in the library so far:

```js
// Get all the available languages
tvDB(key).getLanguages(function(err,res){ });

// Get the current language
tvDB(key).getLanguage();

// Set a different language
tvDB(key).setLanguages(lang);

// Get the current server time
tvDB(key).getTime(function(err,res){ });

// Get the series that matches the name
tvDB(key).getSeries(name, function(err,res){ });

// Get the series basic information that matches the id
tvDB(key).getSeriesById(id, function(err,res){ });

// Get the series full information that matches the id
tvDB(key).getSeriesAllById(id, function(err,res){ });

// Get all the actors of a given series
tvDB(key).getActors(id, function(err,res){ });

// Get all the banners of a given series
tvDB(key).getBanners(id, function(err,res){ });

// Get updated shows since the last time
tvDB(key).getUpdates(time, function(err,res){ });
```
